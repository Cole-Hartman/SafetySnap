## 🚧 The Problem

Construction sites are hazardous environments where safety violations can lead to serious injuries, fatalities, and costly penalties. Identifying OSHA violations early is crucial, but:

- Safety managers can't be everywhere at once  
- Workers may not recognize potential hazards  
- Documentation and reporting are often cumbersome  
- Violations frequently go unnoticed until inspections or incidents

1. **Snap a Photo** of potential hazards at their worksite  
2. **Analyze Instantly** using Gemini AI to identify OSHA violations
